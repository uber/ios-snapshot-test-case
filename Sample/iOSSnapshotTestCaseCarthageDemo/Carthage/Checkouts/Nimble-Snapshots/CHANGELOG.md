## 4.4.1

## 4.4.0

- Adds support for testing dynamic sizes - @bruno.mazzo

  You need the use the new subspec to enjoy this new feature:

  ```ruby
  pod 'Nimble-Snapshots/DynamicSize'
  ```

  Then you can use the new `haveValidDynamicSizeSnapshot` and `recordDynamicSizeSnapshot` matchers to use it:

  ```swift
  let sizes = ["SmallSize": CGSize(width: 44, height: 44),
               "MediumSize": CGSize(width: 88, height: 88),
               "LargeSize": CGSize(width: 132, height: 132)]

  // expect(view).to(recordDynamicSizeSnapshot(sizes: sizes))
  expect(view).to(haveValidDynamicSizeSnapshot(sizes: sizes))

  // You can also just test some sizes:
  expect(view).to(haveValidDynamicSizeSnapshot(sizes: sizes))

  // If you prefer the == syntax, we got you covered too:
  expect(view) == dynamicSizeSnapshot(sizes: sizes)
  expect(view) == dynamicSizeSnapshot(sizes: sizes)
  ```

  By default, the size will be set on the view using the frame property. To change this behavior
  you can use the `ResizeMode` enum:

  ```swift
  public enum ResizeMode {
    case frame
    case constrains
    case block(resizeBlock: (UIView, CGSize)->())
    case custom(ViewResizer: ViewResizer)
  }
  ```

  To use the enum you can `expect(view) == dynamicSizeSnapshot(sizes: sizes, resizeMode: newResizeMode)`.
  For custom behavior you can use `ResizeMode.block`. The block will be call on every resize. Or you can
  implement the `ViewResizer` protocol and resize yourself.
  The custom behavier can be use to record the views too.

For more info on usage, check the [dynamic sizes tests](Bootstrap/BootstrapTests/DynamicSizeTests.swift).

- Improved failure messages by removing the prefix ", got" - @MP0w

## 4.3.0

- Adds support for testing dynamic type - @marcelofabri

  You need the use the new subspec to enjoy this new feature:

  ```ruby
  pod 'Nimble-Snapshots/DynamicType'
  ```

  Then you can use the new `haveValidDynamicTypeSnapshot` and `recordDynamicTypeSnapshot` matchers to use it:

  ```swift
  // expect(view).to(recordDynamicTypeSnapshot()
  expect(view).to(haveValidDynamicTypeSnapshot())

  // You can also just test some sizes:
  expect(view).to(haveValidDynamicTypeSnapshot(sizes: [UIContentSizeCategoryExtraLarge]))

  // If you prefer the == syntax, we got you covered too:
  expect(view) == dynamicTypeSnapshot()
  expect(view) == dynamicTypeSnapshot(sizes: [UIContentSizeCategoryExtraLarge])
  ```

  Note that this will post an `UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification`, so your views/view controllers
  need to observe that and update themselves.

  For more info on usage, check the [dynamic type tests](Bootstrap/BootstrapTests/DynamicTypeTests.swift).

- Removes support for Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.2 - @marcelofabri

## 4.2.0

- Adds Swift 2.3/3.0 support - @carezone

## 4.1.0

- Adds `tolerance` so you can specify tolerance of reference image differences – @mpurland

## 4.0.1

- Adds `recordSnapshot(name=nil)` so you can use `expect(thing) == recordSnapshot()` as this feels much nicer than
  writing `expect(thing).to( recordSnapshot() )` - I'm still not over this `to( thing() )`' bit in Quick. Looks messy. - @orta

## 4.0.0

- Nimble-Snapshots does not call `view?.drawViewHierarchyInRect(bounds, afterScreenUpdates: true)` on your views by default. - @orta

  If this is something that you need in order to get your snapshots passing, you should look at two options:

  - Adding the view to an existing window, then calling `drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:` - this
    is the technique that is used inside `FBSnapshotTestController`, which we now expose as an option in `recordSnapshot`
    and `haveValidSnapshot` as `usesDrawRect`

    ```swift
        expect(imageView).to( recordSnapshot(usesDrawRect: true) )
        expect(imageView).to( haveValidSnapshot(usesDrawRect: true) )
    ```

    You can get more info on the [technique on this issue](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case/issues/91)

* Spending time looking in how you can remove Async code from your App. Or look for places where you are relying on a view structure
  which isn't set up in your tests. There are a bunch of examples in https://github.com/orta/pragmatic-testing on removing Async.
